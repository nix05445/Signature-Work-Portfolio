Brief introduction
•	As you may know… AI… 
•	We will give you a brief risk scenario. There’s been a leak… etc. where we need to write a press conference speech
•	Write the speech you would actually write first
•	Poster: we wrote the speech we would actually write first
•	Give the AI a specific prompt: “write a 200-word press conference speech that talks about…”
o	ChatGPT loves specifics
•	Xcel Energy crisis/Minnesota crisis
•	Treatment conditions should be as separate as possible
•	What is the likelihood that this was written by AI? Same question for both.
•	Only thing that is changing is the two treatment conditions
•	Here’s what we found . . .

Ours
The St. Paul Police Department responded to a car crash on March 15th, 2023, shortly before 5 p.m. This occurred on Cretin Avenue across from the University of St. Thomas campus. One passenger was killed, and a second was injured. 

Randi L. Stone, 35, of Minneapolis, was pronounced dead at the scene. She was found in the back of the vehicle with a fatal head injury, and she was not wearing a seatbelt.

Charges were given to Devin Marcus Chase, 28, for both vehicular theft and homicide. Chase had supposedly been living in the stolen vehicle and had been under the influence of meth and heroin.

Chase has since been taken to the hospital for a dislocated hip and the police say that he will be taken to custody following his release.

The safety and wellbeing of our community is our highest priority, and the St. Paul Police Department is committed to ensuring that standard is upheld. We extend our thoughts and prayers to all involved in this tragic accident.

On March 15th, 2023, a tragic car accident occurred on Cretin Avenue in Saint Paul, Minnesota, resulting in the loss of life and multiple injuries. According to authorities, the accident was caused by an impaired driver who was operating a stolen vehicle at the time of the collision.
Eyewitnesses reported that the driver, who has been identified as a 28-year-old male, was driving at a high rate of speed and swerving in and out of traffic on Cretin Avenue before colliding with two other vehicles. The impact of the crash caused one of the vehicles to overturn, resulting in the death of a 35-year-old female passenger.
Following the accident, the impaired driver attempted to flee the scene on foot but was quickly apprehended by police. He has since been charged with multiple criminal offenses, including vehicular homicide, reckless driving, and possession of a stolen vehicle.
This tragic incident serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of driving under the influence and the devastating impact it can have on innocent lives. It is imperative that we all take responsibility for our actions on the road and make every effort to ensure the safety of ourselves and those around us. Our thoughts and condolences go out to the families affected by this terrible tragedy.

As you may know, AI is a rapidly developing technology that has been sparking conversations and innovation, as well as controversy in recent years. Since AI can provide accurate information, some people may assume that it is an expert on all topics, leading to them believing and following its responses. However, AI is not aware of the potential impact of its actions on society. We already rely on AI in various ways, such as using navigation apps to find the fastest route. 

This survey aims to highlight the importance of transparency in communicating the use of AI.

Poster Presentation

Title/Introduction/Research: Charles
•	AI has been a widespread topic in recent times as it has been developing year by year
o	We are all familiar that AI can produce its own statements and responses
o	There is concern that AI might be powerful threat in the public relations field
	Ex: deceiving readers. We already depend on AI. EX: navigation apps
Goal: Hope
•	To highlight the importance of transparency in using AI for public relations practices
o	We wanted to show that AI can be a valuable tool, but it must be used honestly and responsibly
o	It is not all bad, and it can be beneficial for PR, but it will not replace PR writers

Audience: Charles
•	We thought the audience was for both ways: producer and consumer
•	This study gathered responses largely from the consumer side
•	Results will explain more about our audience

What We Did: Hope
•	We created a survey that asked four questions
o	How familiar are you with AI technology?
o	Two statements, similar to what we did in class with the risk/crisis communication activity
o	They focused on the same subject: a car accident on Cretin Ave
	One was written by Charles and me
	One was written by ChatGPT
o	We sent the survey to our own personal networks, mainly college students
o	Generated 17 responses

What We Found: Charles
•	Before sending out the survey, we expected to get mixed results. We were correct!
•	Question asked how likely the statement was written by AI
•	AI statement responses were largely equally mixed; our statement responses were mostly equally mixed.
•	‘very confident’ responses?

Explanation of Bar Graphs: Charles explains top 2 graphs (AI versus our writing), Hope explains bottom 2 graphs (familiar and confidence)

What It Means/Conclusion: Hope
•	What our results mean is that both PR professionals and people who consume media have responsibility
•	Some critical facts about what AI responses look like
o	Not as personalized
o	A little stuffy/forced
o	Names and ages often aren’t included
•	PR practitioners should always disclose when using AI, even for just a small part of an article
•	For emotional communication, it is our conclusion that good writers will always be needed
•	There is honesty and responsibility that happen on both the PR professional side and the viewer side
o	The more we see AI, the more we might be able to identify what is AI and what is not, but right now we have no idea what’s what, so we shouldn’t make any assumptions
