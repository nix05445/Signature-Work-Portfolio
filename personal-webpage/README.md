To run my webpage:
1.	Open the files above in a code editor
2.	Open up Index.html and launch the program
3.	Once you have the webpage open, you can navigate through the pages through the dropdown menu
   
This is my personal web page project that helped expose me to HTML and CSS for the first time. While this may mean my web page looks basic, it allowed me to learn about web page creation in a way that anyone should be good at, that is, by sharing information about yourself. Four pages that you can navigate through a dropdown menu is what comprises this project. The pages include a bit about both my personal and professional sides. This project allowed me to get creative and ultimately led me to wanting to learn more about front-end development.
