# Signature-Work-Portfolio

  Since the last seven academic semesters, when I declared myself as a Computer Science major and took my first class within that major in the spring of my freshman year, I have learned so much about how computer programs and websites function through languages consisting of lines of words, numbers, and symbols, but also, learned how to problem solve and think how a computer would think when interpreting code. While I cannot say every topic within this major interested me, I still learned how each course was relevant to the field. One way and arguably the most effective way I was able to learn this was through class projects. I did enjoy working on some projects more than others, so I will share more about the projects that are listed in this repository. Two of the projects are from Computer Science courses and one project is from outside of Computer Science, but the topic is related to comparing articles made by humans and AI which includes real data. I chose these projects not because of how much I enjoyed them, but also how they are related to St. Thomas’ mission and/or to the common good.

  The first project I would like to highlight is my personal web page that I created early on in my web development course. This project marks the beginning of exposing myself to HTML and CSS, two programming languages I was eager to learn, so I was glad I was able to first learn and utilize the languages by expressing myself on a website that I made from the ground up. This project relates to St. Thomas’ mission as I am sharing my diverse goals, aspirations, hobbies, and more. While doing so, I had to think what I did and did not want to include as well as how I wanted to format and stylize the information on the pages. This project included the foundations framework for CSS and no extensions for HTML.
  
  The second project I would like to highlight is my St. Paul Crime project that I worked on towards the end of my web development course. With the help of a self-created restful API, this project helped portray crimes throughout the city of St. Paul. It splits the crime data up by type of crime and location of crime by neighborhood. Libraries included Leaflet to allow for mobile-friendly interactive maps, Nominatim which was used for searching open street map data by name and address or by geocode, and Vue.js for building user interfaces. What I liked about this project is how the finished product was something that could be useful for the city of St. Paul. With that said, I feel like this project contributes towards the common good in that it enables me to use programming skills that I have learned at St. Thomas to help with challenges that others may be facing. The crime data will become outdated if I were to not modify the project, but the idea of learning about crime rates around St. Paul and how I can apply skills to advance the common good will remain with me even after graduation. It is projects like this that I enjoy working on. I like to be able to visualize changes that I make in the code, and I like to work on a project that has some sort of meaning in it, even if the final product is not going to be used by someone else. I think that latter part comes from realizing that as a business administration minor, I have really enjoyed the topics I have learned in my business ethics courses, one of them being about creating meaningful work.
  My third project is about discussing the importance and ethics of using AI in communications. I partnered up with a St. Thomas communications major to create a survey for students to determine whether they could distinguish an essay about a specific topic written completely by humans from an essay about the same specific topic written completely by AI. The latter was done by asking AI to write an essay about the same topic after the essay written by humans was completed. After the essays were completed, we created a survey that prompts students to read each essay and determine which one was written by humans and which one by AI. They were also asked to rate their confidence level based on their decisions. From the responses of seventeen students, we discovered that most students could identify the human written essay correctly but the results for determining the AI written essay were equally mixed. We also discovered that most students were not the most confident in their answers. In fact, the couple students who responded with the highest confidence did not correctly distinguish the two essays. What I liked about this project is that we learned how people may think that AI is an expert on all topics since it can oftentimes provide accurate information. While it can do that, AI is not aware of the potential impact of its actions on society, such as deceiving people. We learned that is the responsibility of public relations practitioners to always disclose when they use AI for any part of an article. With that said, this project contributes to the common good as it teaches us that while AI can be beneficial for PR writers depending how it is used, it cannot fully replace them. We already depend on AI in some areas of our lives such as in navigation apps but there are some areas where we should not be too dependent on it. In the project, we also noticed that AI was not able to communicate emotionally, but rather just provide the facts. As a result, that highlights a good reason why we still need good PR writers. This is also a reminder for computer science majors to follow ethical practices when creating a product for consumers. As technology improves, we may become more dependent on it, but that does not mean we should use this to take advantage or deceive those who are less tech-savvy.
