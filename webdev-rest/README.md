This is my St. Paul Crime project that served as my final project for my web development class. This project allowed me to work with APIs for interacting with the database and frameworks for creating the web pages. This project consists of two pages, one for displaying the project itself, which includes the map of St. Paul, an area to look up or create crime incidents, and a list of crimes, and another for describing the APIs and frameworks used along with the project creators. The list of crimes can fluctuate based on what the user does as the database gets rendered on the server-side with the help of a backend API.
